## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r sandbox}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library("readxl")

BCdata <- read_excel(here("data", "bcsped_headcount.xlsx"))

BCdatastripped <- BCdata %>% 
  select("SCHOOL_YEAR", 
         "DATA_LEVEL", 
         "SPECIAL_NEEDS_CODE", 
         "NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS", 
         "PUBLIC_OR_INDEPENDENT") %>% 
  mutate(SPECIAL_NEEDS_CODE = fct_recode(SPECIAL_NEEDS_CODE,
                          "Physically Dependent" = "A",
                          "Deafblind" = "B",
                          "Moderate+ Intellectual Disability" = "C",
                          "Chronic Health Impairment" = "D",
